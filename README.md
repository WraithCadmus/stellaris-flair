# Stellaris Flair Generator

Stellaris is a space-based Grand Strategy game by Paradox Interactive. Like many games it has a community on Reddit. /u/Brolom suggested that flairs (selectable avatars) might be a nice feature.

Having done some work before trying to extract flags from Europa Universalis IV (another Paradox title) I had some code fragments lying around which work processing these.

## Current Extractions

Currently (based on path name) the spritesheet output should contain the icons for 

* Ethics (aka Ethos)
* Governments
* Traits
* Leader Traits

## Current Environment

This script is running on my NAS (CentOS 7) with Python 2.7 and ImageMagick (from EPEL) doing most of the heavy lifting. I did try using Pillow but it didn't like the DDS format, I don't know if that's my error, a shortcoming of DDS support in Pillow, or something awry with the files themselves
